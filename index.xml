      <description>Farfetch is an online store for luxury fashion. In mid-2021, it worked with 550 brands and 2,500 stores in 49 countries. It had two million regular customers and 10 million visits to its website every month. Farfetch helps fashion brands and small stores sell their products online worldwide, even in different countries like Angola and Zimbabwe. They keep their small physical stores but can reach a global market. The website takes an average fee of 28 percent for each sale, which is lower than what is usually charged in the fashion industry.</description>
