Most of its growth in sales comes from China, the Middle East, Latin America, and Eastern Europe. In 2020, Farfetch started selling luxury goods on two of Alibaba’s online platforms in China.\nFarfetch has shown that luxury shoppers don’t always need to see and touch products before buying them online. They also sell luxury items at discounts, which is unusual because luxury brands usually don’t offer sales online. This discounting has caused some issues with other stores lowering their prices too.\nIn 2018, despite not making a profit yet and having lost $255 million since 2015, Farfetch decided to sell its shares to the public. The company was valued at $5 billion, making it one of the most valuable fashion companies.
